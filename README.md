# Z-Factor Calculator Using Hall-Yarborough Method

This project is a Python application that calculates the Z factor (compressibility factor) of a gas using the Hall-Yarborough method.
The Hall-Yarborough method is used in engineering to estimate the compressibility factor for gases, which is essential for various calculations in thermodynamics and fluid dynamics.
The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to input necessary parameters and obtain the Z factor with ease.

### Features

- **Input Gas Composition:** Specify the composition of the gas mixture.
- **Reservoir Conditions:** Enter Pressure(Pa), Temperature(K), and Reduced density parameter.
- **Method Selection:** Choose among Kay's mixing rule, Standing's Correlation, and Sutton's Correlation for calculating critical pressure and temperature of the gas.
- **Hall-Yarborough Calculation:** Computes the Z-factor based on the input parameters and selected method.
