# Z-Factor Calculator Using Hall-Yarborough Method

This project is a Python application that calculates the Z factor (compressibility factor) of a gas using the Hall-Yarborough method.
The Hall-Yarborough method is used in engineering to estimate the compressibility factor for gases, which is essential for various calculations in thermodynamics and fluid dynamics.
The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to input necessary parameters and obtain the Z factor with ease.
